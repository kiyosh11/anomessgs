just some random project i made, it was inspired by @danielcroe (on x.com) ask me a question anonymously 

this is pretty easy to setup, just get a webhook url
- go to discord.com -> on a private server go on a channels settings -> integrations -> webhooks -> create one and copy the url

- go to `.env` and paste that url

- then go to vercel.com and login and then import the project. that's all, have fun!

- if you like this project dont forgot to star even if u dont like it still star lmao

 ⚠️ code is slop dont expect much thx ⚠️
